# Welcome to the Gillespie lab! 


**We are a research group at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) focused on using hippocampal spatial representations as a window into cognitive decline during aging and neurodegenerative disease.**

To do this, we record the spiking activity of large ensembles of neurons from the hippocampus of rats while they learn and perform challenging spatial memory tasks. We  use computational models to understand how the spiking activity we observe relates to the subject's behavior. By comparing such recordings from young, healthy animals to those of much older animals, and even rat strains that have been designed to recapitulate some aspects of Alzheimer's disease, we can ask how the patterns of neural activity change and drive age and disease-related impairments in cognition. For more details about our ongoing projects, see [Research](research)).


 We believe in doing rigorous, exciting science in a supportive and fun environment. We welcome colleagues of all backgrounds and identities, and are committed to their well-being and success. We strive to advance scientific knowledge while also pushing to improve academic culture in all the scientific communities we are part of. **We are looking for new lab members to join the team** [(Join us!)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
