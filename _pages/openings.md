# Open positions

### We are in the process of building our team! 

**Postdocs:** See instructions below. 

**Grad Students:** Our lab will be affiliated with the [Neuroscience graduate program](https://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/) and the [Molecular Medicine & Mechanisms of Disease](https://sites.uw.edu/m3d/) (M3D) graduate program. All graduate students **must** be admitted through these programs; the lab cannot directly accept students. We will be accepting rotation students from these programs in Fall 2024. Please contact Anna if you've been admitted to a different UW graduate program and are interested in the lab.

**Undergrads:** We may have space for a student with an engineering background - please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/3mvK7iZq7drdhP7n6) and contact Anna if interested. 

### For all prospective lab members
Please get in touch with [Anna]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team)! In your email, make sure to include: your CV, a brief description of your research background/experience, and, most importantly, why you're interested in being part of **this** team, specifically!
