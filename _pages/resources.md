### Career
I believe in sharing materials to make academia more fair & transparent. You'll have to request access, but it will be rapidly granted! 

**BRAIN Initiative K99/R00 (2019)** [ Application materials, rebuttal, progress report, extension request](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R5Pl7TitkIa5HdQH0LBTnCnkosFIC1n0?usp=sharing) 

**Faculty Applications (2021)** [Anna's reflections on the academic job market]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/gillespie.pdf) ~ [ Application materials ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NO-0TC0NtO63ACdisLsQnGTT80trS1PL?usp=sharing) 

**R00 Transition Application** [ Application materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q7S0Gsc2V5S4A7y_h13mQS33W-iTAgmE?usp=sharing) 
Don't underestimate how much time this will take - start several months (>3) before your faculty appointment date! 

Johns Hopkins lists of [funding opportunities](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/) for undergrads, grad students, postdocs, & ECRs (early career researchers)

[List of neuro-related postdoc seminar series](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBvj4aUEBMDN3KFhCTv0GxAMJ0RbJhsPx0woa4YlgXs/edit?usp=sharing) - great to apply for these as a senior postdoc before/during faculty application season *please add any that you know of!*

### UW Resources 

[The Mill](https://hfs.uw.edu/The-Mill/Home), an awesome maker space free for students and cheap for UW affiliates. Great for laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC, etc

[SafeCampus](https://www.washington.edu/safecampus/), an anonymous hotline to discuss safety/wellbeing concerns for yourself or others

[UW Allies](https://sites.uw.edu/uwallies/), support for grad students and postdocs in basic science labs facing difficult situations
