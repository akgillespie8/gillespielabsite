I'm extremely happy to be spending my work days puzzling over the inner workings of the hippocampus and constantly learning how to be a better scientist and mentor. In the evenings, I'm probably focused on food (finding new fun places to eat or recipes to loosely follow) or fussing over my plant babies. I try to get outside as often as possible to  hike or bike - I have so many places around Seattle to explore!
