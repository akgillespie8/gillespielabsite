# Research

**Our overarching goal is to understand how the neural mechanisms of memory break down in the advanced age and neurodegenerative disease and to develop novel interventional approaches to prevent such decline.**

We simultaneously record hundreds of neurons in the hippocampus of rats as they learn and perform complex memory-dependent tasks. Many neurons in the hippocampus are sensitive to spatial location, and these "place cells" fire in specific locations in space, as the movie to the right shows (credit: Tom Davidson). Each putative single neuron is represented by a different color, and emits spikes as the animal (head position circled in green) passes through the neuron's "place field" as it completes a u-shaped trajectory. Collectively, this neural activity represents the spatial aspect of the experience that the animal is having. 


However, hippocampal neural activity doesn't **always** correspond to a subject's current position. Instead, the neural representation of position can briefly represent other locations - such as where the subject is headed, distant parts of an environment, or even other environments entirely. This "mental simulation" of previously experienced locations is thought to be critical for memory consolidation as well as memory-guided decision-making.  But what happens to "mental simulations" during cognitive decline?

One neural mechanism of consolidation is called hippocampal replay, when the neural ensemble corresponding to an experience is rapidly **reactivated** during sleep or pauses in behavior. 



**Theta sequences** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.
