# Research

**Our overarching goal is to understand how the neural mechanisms of memory break down in the advanced age and neurodegenerative disease and to develop novel interventional approaches to prevent such decline.**

To do this, we simultaneously record hundreds of neurons in the hippocampus of rats as they learn and perform complex memory-dependent tasks. Many neurons in the hippocampus are sensitive to spatial location, and these "place cells" fire in specific locations in space, as the movie to the right shows (credit: Tom Davidson). This neural activity represents the spatial aspect of the experience that the animal is having.

However, hippocampal neural activity doesn't **always** correspond to a subject's current position. Instead, the neural representation of position can briefly represent other locations - such as where the subject is headed, distant parts of an environment, or even other environments entirely. This "mental simulation" of previously experienced locations is thought to be critical for memory consolidation as well as memory-guided decision-making.  But what happens to "mental simulations" during cognitive decline?

One neural mechanism of consolidation is called hippocampal replay, when the neural ensemble corresponding to an experience is rapidly **reactivated** during sleep or pauses in behavior.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.Â

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
