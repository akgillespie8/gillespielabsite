- title: "Hippocampal replay reflects specific past experiences rather than a plan for subsequent choice"
  image: sungodrat.png
  description: Hippocampal replay has frequently be hypothesized to subserve planning purposes. We show here that in a well-learned spatial memory task, replay content does not tend to represent the upcoming choice of the animal, but instead is biased towards representing previous goal locations. This suggests a role for memory maintentance and updating rather than in directly planning subsequent choice.

  description: Using a state-space model to formalize how spatial representations can evolve within replay events, we describe a variety of replay types (stationary, continuous, and fragmented) as well as a statistical method to evaluate our confidence in these representations.

- title: "Early Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripple Deficits Predict Later Learning and Memory Impairments in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model"
  image: predicts.jpg
  description: By recording from apoE3 and apoe4-KI mice over long time periods, we discovered that some changes in SWR features, such as slow gamma power, were predictive of later behavioral impairment. This finding supports the use of patterns of hippocampal activity, such as sharp wave ripples, and biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease processes.

- title: "Apolipoprotein E4 Causes Age-Dependent Disruption of Slow Gamma Oscillations During Hippocampal Sharp-wave Ripples"
  image: e4slowgamma.jpg
  description: This study was the first to characterize abnormalities in hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in apoe4-KI mice. We found that apoE4 mice showed reduced rates of SWRs as well as compromised SWR-associated slow gamma oscillations. Removing pathogenic apoE4 from hippocampal interneurons, a manipulation which prevents cognitive impairment, rescued the slow gamma deficit.
