  description: "Our neurofeedback training paradigm couples online detection of SWRs with rapid positive feedback (food reward). The training paradigm dramatically increases SWR rate during the targeted interval, and these SWRs correspond to high-quality replay events with flexible, task relevant content."

- title: "Hippocampal replay reflects specific past experiences rather than a plan for subsequent choice"
  image: sungodrat.png
  description: Hippocampal replay has frequently been hypothesized to subserve planning purposes. We show that in a well-learned spatial memory task, replay content does not overrepresent the upcoming choice of the animal, but instead is biased towards previous goal locations. This suggests a role for replay in memory maintentance rather than directly planning subsequent choice.

- title: "Hippocampal replay of experience at real-world speeds. "

  description: Using a state-space model to formalize how spatial representations can evolve within replay events, we describe a variety of replay types (stationary, continuous, and fragmented) as well as a statistical method to evaluate our confidence in these representations.

  image: predicts.jpg
  description: By recording from apoE3 and apoe4-KI mice over long time periods, we discovered that some changes in SWR features, such as slow gamma power, were predictive of later behavioral impairment. This finding supports the use of patterns of hippocampal activity, such as sharp wave ripples, and biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease processes.

  image: e4slowgamma.jpg
  description: This study was the first to characterize abnormalities in hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in apoe4-KI mice. We found that apoE4 mice showed reduced rates of SWRs as well as compromised SWR-associated slow gamma oscillations. Removing pathogenic apoE4 from hippocampal interneurons, a manipulation which prevents cognitive impairment, rescued the slow gamma deficit.
